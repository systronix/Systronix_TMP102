# Systronix_TMP102
Arduino library for the Texas Instruments precision I2C temperature sensor TMP102
This library supports the full temperature range of the TMP102, from -40C to +125C, at full resolution.
This is a work in progress but the current code has been extensively tested and works. Also included is
an example/test program which verifies the conversion algorithm by feeding it simulated known data.
